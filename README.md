Note about anti-cheat software
------------------------------
This game uses anti-cheat software that is running even while in single player.

As far as we know our 3D fixes have never triggered a ban with these type of
services, but if you play with it enabled you do so at your own risk.

If you want to be on the safe side you can disable it by launching the game
with the -eac_launcher option - if done correctly you will get a message on the
main menu that the anti cheat software is not installed and multiplayer will be
unavailable.
