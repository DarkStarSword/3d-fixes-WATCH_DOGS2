Note about anti-cheat software
------------------------------
This game uses anti-cheat software that is running even while in single player.

As far as we know our 3D fixes have never triggered a ban with these type of
services, but if you play with it enabled you do so at your own risk.

If you want to be on the safe side you can disable it by launching the game
with the -eac_launcher option. If you are launching through UPlay you can go
into the properties page for the game and use "Add launch arguments" to add
this. If done correctly you will get a message when the game launches that the
anti cheat software is not installed and multiplayer will be unavailable.
