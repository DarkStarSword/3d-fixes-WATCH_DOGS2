- Thick fog that occasionally rolls in over the bay is clipping incorrectly (to
  confirm if this is still an issue)
- Screen space reflections were broken with temporal filtering at some point
  (looks like a mono depth buffer needs steroising), but mysteriously fixed
  themselves.
- Leaves still only displaying in one eye for some people
	- check single GPU
	- Driver started steroising the wind buffer after a while
